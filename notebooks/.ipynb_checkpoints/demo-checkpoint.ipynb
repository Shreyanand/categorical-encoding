    "# Categorical Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning problems such as anomaly detection and clustering are challenging due to lack of labels required for training embeddings and validating the results. Therefore, it becomes essential to use the right encoding schemes, dimensionality reduction methods, and models. Manipulating numerical variables is pretty straightforwad as they can be easily plugged into statistical methods. For example, it is easy to find mean and standard deviations in the height of a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables need to be handled carefully as they have to be converted to numbers. Ordinal categorical variables have an inherent ordering from one extreme to the other, for e.g., sentiment can be very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive. We can use simple integer encoding or contrast encoding for these variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on encoding schemes for nominal categorical variables. These variables are particularly challenging because there is no inherent ordering in the variables, for e.g., weather can be rainy, sunny, snowy, etc. Encoding to numbers is challenging because we don't want to distort the distances between the levels of the variables. In other words, if we encode rainy as 0, sunny as 1, and snowy as 2 then the model will interpret rainy to be closer to sunny than snowy which is not true. A common approach is to use one-hot encoding scheme. The method works well because all the one hot vectors are orthogonal to each other and so true distances are preserved. However, when the cardinality of the variables increase, one-hot encoding explodes the computation. For example, if we have 1000 different types of weather conditions then one-hot would give a 1000 dimension vector. To improve performance, we may choose to reduce dimensions using various forms matrix decomposition techniques. However, since we cannot go back to original dimensional space, we lose explainability in this process. Therefore, we search for encoders that optimally balance the trade-off between performance and explainability."
